<h1 style="color: green; font-size:30px">SDG-13: Climate Action</h1>

<h1 style="color: yellow; font-size:20px">Introduction:</h1>
<body>
  <p style="color:white";>Though you may not realize it, <strong>Climate Change</strong> is having an incredulously magnanimous impact on our day-to-day lives. With its effect being present in various fields, from Agriculture, to the present availability of Fresh Water. This issue impacts <strong> everyone. </strong>This exact subject, is what the Sustainable Development Goal 13, Climate Action, is regarding.</p>
</body>
<body>
  <p style="color:white";>One prominent impact of Climate Change, on our daily lives, is the rising cost of foods. Due to extensive droughts and floods over the last decade, food pricing, especially wheat and barley, have risen by incredible margins during the last few years. The pinnacle of this being a 20% rise in food markets within large parts of Europe and the United States, in 2018. A second impact is the nearing lack of fresh, unsalted water. Due to countless freshwater beds and glaciers globally drying up, it is making natural freshwater much scarcer. There are other ways to gain fresh water, such as reverse osmosis, but those use extensive amounts of power, heavily contributing to climate change, thus making a cycle of ruin. Developing, or third-world countries such as India and Africa are at the most risk, though several parts of Western America are also facing the challenges.</p>

<h1 style="color: yellow; font-size:20px">Summary:</h1>

  <p style="color:lime";>Climate Change impacts our daily lives in many ways. From making food more expensive, to raising the cost of various commodities used by us everyday, and even forces people to sell fresh water at a higher cost. This website is regarding the Sustainable Development Goal 13, (SDG-13) which is regarding Climate Change, and Climate Action. </p>

<h1 style="color: yellow; font-size:20px">What is The Issue?</h1>
  <p style="color:white";>This is an implausibly magnanimous issue in modern day life. Malaysia is currently in the
process of moving their capital city, due to the current one sinking. Wildlife populations have been dropping by staggering margins, with a loss of 60%, in only the last 4 decades, as well as worldwide, the surface temperature has risen over 1.5 degrees, celsius. This is truly a catastrophe, with recent data surrounding it seeming to be straight from science fiction novels. As clearly depicted in the graph below, average global temperatures have been rising by a staggering margin. It is clearly stating the change from the 1850s, until 2019, showing the immense change in temperature, by a seemingly impossible amount. Very recent data shows that by 2030, the harm done will be irreversible. The time for action is now.</p>

<h1 style="color: yellow; font-size:20px">Summary:</h1>

  <p style="color:lime";>Climate Change is a remarkably large and relevant problem. As you can see the graph above, the temperature of the planet has been going up, incredibly quickly. On the surface, the temperature has risen by 1.5 degrees celsius, and over half of the natural wildlife population have been dashed, within the last 40 years. </p>

<h1 style="color: yellow; font-size:20px">Why Do We Need A Solution?</h1>
  <p style="color:white";>Climate change makes a very severe and lasting impact on global temperatures and weather. The last 10 years, 2010-2020, have been the warmest recorded years in history. This will only get worse with time, and without a change, the surface of the Earth will eventually get heated to the point of being unlivable for humans. This is only <I> one </I> problem that Climate Change causes. Other affects that are vividly shown, include changes in the environment, general fresh food supply, access to packed-ice water, and even to our health. This is truly horrible, and a change must be made. Most of the population is aware of Climate Change, through various media outputs, but a thorough knowledge on its impact and a person’s power on it, is missing. Since we, the new generation, are going to end up making the large world decisions one day, first we need to be informed. </p>

<h1 style="color: yellow; font-size:20px">Summary:</h1>

  <p style="color:lime";> The reason why <strong>now</strong> is the time for a solution, is due to the problem continuing to worsen with time, causing countless issues, such as changes in the environment, lack of general fresh food supply for many countries, access to water in the form of packed ice, crop-produced food shortages, and even to our health.</p>

<h1 style="color: yellow; font-size:20px">What Are Possible, Relevant, Solutions?</h1>
  <p style="color:white";> In the current day and age, one feasible solution, is the extensive support on restoration of worldwide tropical forests. The reason why this is relevant, is due the current issue in the Amazon, the largest global rainforest, burning down, releasing incredible amounts of C02 into the atmosphere. Restoring this grand production of nature, would allow the plants within to slowly intake carbon dioxide, removing it from the atmosphere, which will cause a domino effect, eventually healing the environment. With this restoration plan, anywhere from 61, to 89 GT of carbon dioxide could be removed in the next 30 years. This would also assist in stopping food shortages to people relying on the natural materials within it, and heal the ozone layer. </p>

<h1 style="color: yellow; font-size:20px">Summary:</h1>

  <p style="color:lime";>Basically, <strong> supporting wildlife restoration acts</strong> such as the support for stopping the fires within the Amazon rainforest, would allow the trees to naturally decrease the carbon dioxide within the air, allowing our ozone layer to regenerate, as well, it would stop food shortages for large numbers of people relying on the forests for a steady source of food.</p>

<h1 style="color: yellow; font-size:20px">Conclusion:</h1>
  <p style="color:white";>In conclusion, Climate Change is an issue of grave importance, and must be promptly dealt with. Stop waiting for others to do so, take initiative, and follow a two step plan to success. Raise awareness to others within friend-groups, school or living communities, as well as family members, and strive to support important foundations ad restoration projects based on the saving of rainforests, and the climate as a whole. The time for change, is now. </p>
